# 50-50--day-4
Fourth JS project in the challenge!

## General Info

Very easy hidden search button. What I got out of this project was a reminder to use the toggle method! I had used "add" and "remove", on the same event, where I should have used toggle on recent projects. I will need to go back and substitute those with the toggle method.
